      <h3>What is Fundgrazing.com all about?</h3>
      <ul class="a">
          <li><p>We're an online marketplace where people like you can mint your own money.</p></li>
          <li><p>Use our system to make money selling nothing at all. It's easy peasy and anyone can do it, even if you have never sold anything online before.</p></li>
          <li><p>Our system is unique because it automatically generates product for you to sell. You do not have to worry about what goods you have to sell or even how or who to sell them too. Just consume items from the marketplace and more items will appear there in your name. We've eliminated all of the usual hassles of owning and operating an online store by reducing the sales process down to a single transaction.</p></li>
          <li><p>The site is designed to double your money each time you consume another users item.</p></li>
