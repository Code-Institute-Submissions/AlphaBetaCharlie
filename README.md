# The Alpha Beta Charlie Society

## Introduction

Alpha Beta Charlie is the worlds first eCommerce solution dedicated to selling absolutely nothing. To accomplish this the site uses its cart system to generate new inventory for sellers once they successfully complete a transaction as a buyer through the checkout process.

The site owner has petitioned for a provisionary patent to protect the unique process described above. As mentioned this site is the first site in the world dedicated to selling nothing, but it is also the first eCommerce solution to increase inventory instead of deplete inventory when a transaction successfully completes its processing. This is the basis of the patent filing.

Once the buyer successfully completes a transaction on the site the buyer becomes a seller on the site. This too is a unique charateristic not found on any other eCommerce site in the world and is another basis for seeking patent to protect the process used to alter the role of the user. 


## Selling Items and Tracking Transactions

Users of this site buy and sell virtual items known as Beta and Charlie. Beta and Charlie are the only items for sell on the site. To get these items a seller must consume another sellers Beta or Charlie item. Once they do and successfully complete the checkout process the consumed Beta or Charlie transaction item is archived and a new Beta and Charlie transaction is spawned. These new items are associated with the buyers account and when they are consumed by another user the account they are associated with is credited with the value of the transaction.

This site generates new inventory items for its users each time an item is purchased by another user. This process is known as consuming items and is necessary for the sellers to stock their store with items to sell.

The site uses foreign keys to track transactions. Items are dynamically placed in view with each user session. Inventory is generated by consuming other users transactions. The site auto generates a

## UX

### Users 
The site is open to any and all users from all walks of life. It is anticipated that the site would be most attractive to students age 14 to 24 years as they would most likely be the demographic looking for passive income to support their lifestyles.

The hope is that the student will quickly spread the word amongst their peers and that the site will instantly go viral. If it proves itself useful at generating free money by selling nothing we anticipate these students will be more than willing to share their experiences on the site especially considering the more users on the site the more everyone makes.

### User Stories
1. A new user, alpha_john, is a first year college student from San Diego, California. He has managed to spawn 48 new Beta's and 40 new Charlie's in the first 24 hours since initiating his Alpha. This netted the user $140.00 with the potential to earn another $56 if others transact with his remaining Beta and Charlie transactions that are still floating around the marketplace. The excitement is to much to keep contained so he contacts his mother and tells her about the site. She shares this info with her husband and their daughter who is a final year of high school. All three decide to join the community. ALl three also mention the site to friends and colleagues in passing throughout the day. The result of John's success has seen the sites San Diego membership increase by 37 new members the same day alpha_john shared the news with his family.
2. Following on from the story about alpha_john's success... The 37 new members the site gained in the San Diego area presumably as a result of alpha_john sharing his success with his family and them spreading the word. The system has seen 467 new members join in the Southern California region within 2 days of alpha_john sharing his story.
3. Karen, a homemaker in London stumbled across a a friends facebook post who is a society member. The post mentioned how easy it was to earn extra income using the sites gaming engine so she decided to give it a go. She became a member and within 10 minutes had already earned £7 and had the possibility of earning another £3. She was so delighted she posted her results on her facebook page where she has 462 friends. We're hoping those a good portion of those friends see her post and take the time to become members themselves.
